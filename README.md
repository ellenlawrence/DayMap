# DayMap

## Summary

**DayMap** is a vacation day-planning site that allows users to search for and select sights they would like to visit in various cities across the U.S., and then creates and displays the most efficient route from the userâ€™s location passing through each sight and ending back at the user's original location. This lets users figure out the order in which they should visit each sight they had planned for a day on vacation, and also provides them with step by step directions for each leg of their customized route.
